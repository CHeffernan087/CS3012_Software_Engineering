# CS3012_Software_Engineering

This is a project undertaken for a third year module in software engineering.
The purpose of the assignment is to experiment with new technologies, use version control software and gain experience with a development process. I elected to do the assignment in python as it was a language which I had some small experience in but had never dug too deeply into. The concept of object orientation in this language was completely new to me. Throughout the course of my development experience I have learnt a lot about the nuances of object orientation in python, particularly with the self key word which I would have assumed was analagous to the this key word in java but actually has some differences.
