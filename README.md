# CS3012_Software_Engineering

This is a project undertaken for a third year module in software engineering.

The purpose of the assignment is to experiment with new technologies, use version control software and gain experience with a development process. I elected to do the assignment in python as it was a language which I had some small experience in but had never dug too deeply into. The concept of object orientation in this language was completely new to me. Throughout the course of my development experience, I have learnt a lot about the nuances of object orientation in python e.g with respect to constructors , defaults, the self key word etc.

I also gained experience using the vscode,nano and sublime text editos. Initially I began this project using sublime text, but when I discovered the superior python linter that could be easily configured in vscode , I opted to continue the project using that environment. I used nano to make small file changes e.g to this Readme, where an editor with a linter would be unnecessary.

The actual problem being solved by the code in this repo is that of the lowest common ancestor. i.e the furthest point from a given root node from which two other given nodes can be reached. The assignment had to first be completed using a binary search tree and then using a directed graph. 100% of the code in this repo has been authored by me.
